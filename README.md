## Usage

```typescript
import { opaAuthPlugin } from "@treedom/mercurius-auth-opa";
import { opaAuthDirective } from "@treedom/mercurius-auth-opa/opaAuthDirective";

const schema = `#graphql
  ${opaAuthDirective}

  type Query {
    ping(message: String!): String! @opa(path: "my/opa/policy", options: { ... })
  }`

app.register(mercurius, {
  schema,
  resolvers: {
    Query: {
      ping: (source, args) => args.message,
    },
  },
})

app.register(opaAuthPlugin, {
  opaEndpoint: 'https://my.opa.endpoint',
})
```

## OPA policy input

This plugin queries OPA providing the following properties as `input`

- `headers` the Fastify headers object
- `parent` the Mercurius parent object of the field/object which got queried
- `args` the Mercurius args object of the field/object which got queried
- `options` static untyped properties defined in the directive arguments _(optional)_

### Example Rego Policy

Let's imagine a GraphQL server which accept requests authorized using JWTs containing the `role` property in their claims.
The following Rego uses a hypotetical `oidc.verify_token` that validates the JWT signature and returns the token claims
or false if the token is not valid.

```rego
package my.opa.policy

import rego.v1
import data.oidc

default allow := false

allow if {
    user := oidc.verify_token(input.headers.authorization)

    user
    user.role = "admin"
}
```

## Custom directive

The authorization directive can be customized registering a custom one in the schema and specifying its name in the plugin configuration

```graphql
scalar OpaOptions
directive @policy(path: String!, options: OpaOptions) on OBJECT | FIELD_DEFINITION
```

```typescript
app.register(opaAuthPlugin, {
  // ...
  authDirective: 'policy'
})
```

## OPA Options

This plugins uses Styra's `@styra/opa` SDK to perform queries to the OPA server. Its options can be changed via configuration.
See the [official documentation](https://styrainc.github.io/opa-typescript/)

```typescript
app.register(opaAuthPlugin, {
  // ...
  opaOptions: {
    // ...
  }
})
```

## Native Node.js fetch

This plugin relies on `@styra/opa` which internally relies on _native Node.js fetch_ which is available as an **experimental**
feature from _Node.js 16_ and as a **stable** feature in _Node.js 22_
